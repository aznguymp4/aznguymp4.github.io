        By using our website and/or bot, you agree that you have read and agree to this policy.
        <br>
        The terms “our”, “we”, and “us” refers to the sole developer behind aznbot.mp4, and the term “bot” refers to the Discord bot itself.
        <br><br>
        We follow legal requirements to protect your informational privacy. Our Privacy Policy is a legal statement describing how we may collect information from you, how we may share that information, and how you can limit our sharing of said information.
        <br><br>
        We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. It's recommended that you check this Privacy Policy often if you plan on being a frequent visitor. If changes are made to this Privacy Policy, an announcement will be made in our <a href="https://discord.gg/ZXQ6yXtWjG">Discord Server</a>.
        <br><br>
        <h3><b>Collected Information</b></h3>
        With our bot, you can generally control how much information you give us. Most information authorization is done with Discord OAuth2, (a.k.a. “Login with Discord”), which tells you which information will be sent to the application/bot before you authorize yourself. Information typically collected consists of your Discord username, Discord user ID, and Discord avatar.
        <br><br>
        <h3><b>How your information is used</b></h3>
        Your basic Discord account information is used to provide extra features such as changing bot settings on our website, and tracking scores for the bot's game commands.
        <br><br>
        <h3><b>Information about Third Parties</b></h3>
        We do not sell or provide your collected information to third parties for marketing purposes. Messages distributed by our bot may contain links to third-party websites. These linked websites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked website or nested link contained in these linked websites. Such links may be distributed only for convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the website does not imply endorsement of the linked website by us and our Privacy Policy.
        <br><br>
        <h3><b>Legally Required Releases of Information</b></h3>
        We may be legally required to disclose your information, if such disclosure is (a) required by subpoena, law, or other legal process; (b) necessary to assist law enforcement officials or government enforcement agencies; (c) necessary to investigate violations of or otherwise enforce our Legal Terms; (d) necessary to protect us from legal action or claims from third parties including you and/or other members; and/or (e) necessary to protect the legal rights, personal/real property, or personal safety of member(s) behind aznbot.mp4 development, our users, employees, and affiliates.
